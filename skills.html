				<li>HTML - Currently in the early to mid stages of learning and mastering html. I am becoming more fluent in the code and learning how it integrates with CSS.</li>
				<li>CSS - CSS is the language that I am most unfamiliar with but am steadily gaining experience in through the curriculum at LearningFuze. Originally, I thought that it was purely for styling, but have found that it is much more complex and powerful than I imagined.</li>
				<li>Javascript - Surprisingly, this is the language in which I have the most experience. I also find this to be the area of web development that most interests me. I truly enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect of Javascript.</li>
