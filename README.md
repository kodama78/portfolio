This is a portfolio of my projects that I have completed and work that I am currently working on. It will be updated regularly with changes to the projects as well as the overall design scheme.

### Design

The design of the portfolio was inspired by the artowrk for my self-published novel. I used the cover art and separated them into 3 different pieces so as to use them in a parallax design. The night sky flows down into the forest which is laying on top of the lake/fire picture.


## Plugins

### Scrollmagic

To control the parallax I am using the scrollmagic plugin. I chose this one due to the high level of control it gave me over the scrolling as well as the fact that it was jquery/js based and therefore allowed me to call my own custom functions with it
