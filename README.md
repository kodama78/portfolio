# Adding existing files to GitHub

This repository (**repo**) was built to show you one method to include pre-existing files into a new repo.  While it is not the most direct way, it is easier to understand with the toolset that we currently have access to.

The workflow outlined in the readme below will be utilized for every assignment/task/project for the course so understanding how and why is super important. If you have any questions please feel free to email instructors@learningfuze.com

### Assumptions we are making
- You have Git installed on your system. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+i+know+if+git+is+installed+on+my+computer" target="_blank">How do I know if git is installed?</a>
- You understand how to add files, commit, and push in git
	- [Git Workflow](https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/git-workflow/blob/master/README.md)

## Migrating your portfolio to GitHub

### Step 1 - Fork this repo

- Go to GitHub and fork this repo to your account
- Open git-workflow directory by clicking on File->Open

### Step 2 - Clone *your* repo
- Copy the link from your github account for your portfolio repo
- Navigate to your sandbox folder
- Open up your terminal / git bash to your sandbox folder
- Clone your repo
    - git clone [your repo name]

### Step 3 - Navigate to the newly created folder
- In your file system (finder / explorer) navigate to the newly created "portfolio" folder

### Step 4 - Copy your files from your original portfolio to your git portfolio
- Copy the files, not move, though it wouldn't matter tremendously.

### Step 5 - Commit your files to your repo (See [here](https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/git-workflow/blob/master/README.md) if you need a refresher
- Go to your terminal / git bash
- Add your new files to git
    - git add .
- Commit your files to git
    - git commit -m '[your git commit message here]'
- Push your files
    - git push origin master

#### You have done it! Your portofolio has now been added to your github account

- Please note that text surrounded with brackets "[]" is meant for you to substitute your own corresponding value into the area, without the brackets.  For example: "hello [your name]"  would become "hello John" if your name was John.
